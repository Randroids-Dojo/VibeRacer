# Followups

Backlog spillover discovered during implementation. Keep items PR-sized when possible.

## High Priority

- None recorded.

## Medium Priority

- None recorded.

## Low Priority

- Gamepad rumble: collision-magnitude impulses. Blocked until gameplay has a real collision event source. Current barriers, cones, trees, and decorations are visual-only, and the physics integrator only emits off-track drag state. Once the vehicle can hit a wall or obstacle, emit an impact magnitude so the rumble path can scale a one-shot cue to contact strength.
